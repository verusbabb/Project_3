# Trip Planner

An app allows user to collaborate on trip planning and view trip details in a shared work space.

## Problem

When planning a trip with a group, it is challenging to keep everyone on the same page and have easy access to all of the information or to collaborate on ideas/schedules, etc. Email, texting, and using shared calendars are often informally used among the group to plan and ideate and document schedules.  Communication threads can get long.  Details get lost.  No central dashboard for the group to view trip details and plan together.

## Solution
A one-stop-shop web space for sharing and collaborating on all details related to group trips.

## User Story
AS an authenticated user

I WANT to be able to collaborate on planning trip details and view trip details
SO that I can be more informed, organized, and efficient in participating in planning and anticipating how to prepare for the trip
